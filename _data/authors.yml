    Yan Zheng is a Research Assistant Professor working in the field of atmospheric chemistry,
    with a focus on volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxidation mechanisms, and the formation
    of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Her research integrates molecular-level observations,
    advanced mass spectrometry, chamber/lab simulations to understand 
    how chemical processes shape urban and regional air quality under evolving climate conditions.
