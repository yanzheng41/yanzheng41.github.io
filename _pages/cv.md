Education
======
* Ph.D in Environmental Chemistry, Peking University, 2022 (supervisor: [Prof. Qi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QgN0jXcAAAAJ&hl=en))
* B.S. in Environmental Science, Nanjing University, 2016

Academic Positions
======
* 2025-current: Research Assistant Professor (Host: [Prof. Zhe Wang](https://envrwangz.people.ust.hk/))
  * Division of Environment and Sustainability (ENVR), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)
* 2022-2025: Postdoctoral Fellow (Host: [Prof. Qi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QgN0jXcAAAAJ&hl=en))
  * Environmental Sciences and Engineering (CESE), Peking University

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on advancing the characterization of atmospheric chemical composition through field observations and laboratory simulations, with the goal of understanding its variations in a changing climate. I specialize in ground-based and mobile measurements using state-of-the-art online mass spectrometry techniques, as well as laboratory oxidation experiments to probe the formation and evolution of atmospheric aerosols. I have extensive expertise in operating aerosol mass spectrometers (AMS), aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSM), and chemical ionization mass spectrometers (CIMS), applying them across 15 field campaigns and in the laboratory.

Publications
======
As of Nov 2025, I have published 27 peer-reviewed journal articles. Times Cited: 843 and H-index: 16 (web of science); Times Cited: 1085 and H-index: 18 (google scholar).

Grants
======
* National Science Fund of China (NSFC), Young Scholars Program (Leading, RMB 300,000)
  Title: Experimental study on how extreme heat weather condition affects the aqueous and heterogeneous formation of secondary organic aerosol

Service
======
* **Referee**: reviewer for journals including Environmental science & technology letters (ESTL), Atmospheric Environment (AE), and Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP)
