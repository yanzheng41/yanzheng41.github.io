Welcome! This is Yan, currently working as a Research Assistant Professor in the Division of Environment and Sustainability ([ENVR](https://envr.ust.hk/)), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/)). Prior to HKUST, I worked as postdoc at College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering ([CESE](https://cese.pku.edu.cn/)), Peking University from 2022 to 2025. 

I am specializing in **atmospheric chemistry**, with a particular focus on the **formation mechanisms, molecular composition, and environmental impacts of organic aerosols (OA)**. My research integrates **field observations** and **laboratory experiments** to understand how volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidize in the atmosphere and form OA in different environments. I work extensively with advanced mass spectrometry techniques, including aerosol mass spectrometers **(LTOF-AMS, Soot-particle AMS, TOF-ACSM, Q-ACSM)** and chemical ionization mass spectrometers **(Iodide-CIMS with FIGAERO, Nitrate-CIMS, PTR-QiTOF)**.

I received my Ph.D. in Environmental Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2022, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Qi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QgN0jXcAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my B.Sc. in Environmental Chemistry from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2016.  

  
My recent work examines (1) OA formation under extreme-heat conditions, (2) refined source apportionment of OA with multi-instrument datasets, (3) multiphase Chemistry of SOA in urban and mountain areas including processes in aerosols and clouds, (4) long-term trends of urban OA sources using 2016–2024 datasets, (5) coupling ambient data and machine learning to explore driving factors of SOA formation.
